  displayName: Edge Optimized DotNet App
  description: This is a small footprint DotNet application with GUI based on SignalRS and RabbitMQ Streams.  It is a pattern for moving data off edge to cloud or DC when connectivity is spotty.  It requires a local rabbitmq instance with Stream and Shovel plugins enabled.
